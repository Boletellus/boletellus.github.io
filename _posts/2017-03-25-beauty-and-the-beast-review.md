I saw [*Beauty and the Beast*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(2017_film)) last night. Here is my very brief review.

### Positives

- Teaching kids that being gay is okay is a great thing.
- The digital effects were nice.
- Luke Evans was fantastic as Gaston. His performance evinced the most emotions from me. All the other performances left me yawning.

### Negatives

*Beauty and the Beast* had very little going for it emotionally. Except for Luke Evans performance, watching the film felt like watching a group of bored actors delivering uninspired performances. I don't think I felt for one moment that I had left the movie theater; the film failed to draw me into its fictional universe.

The one time I found the film displaying some evidence of having an emotional heartbeat was when the last petal of the cursed rose fell, and all of the Beast's servants were doomed to forever remain inanimate objects. I actually felt a modicum of sadness for them. It would've been great if the film had ended there. It would've salvaged it somewhat for me.

But, in what may be one of the more heavy-handed examples of *Deus ex machina* in recent memory, the Enchantress, who had initially applied the curse, effectively reversed time and returned the cursed to their original forms. Remember how Superman saved Lois Lane in the first [Superman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(1978_film)) movie? Yeah, this ending kinda sucks in the same way.
